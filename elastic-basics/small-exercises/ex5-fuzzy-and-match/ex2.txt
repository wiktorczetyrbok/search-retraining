Create a search request for  the products index using only one match query with query = WITH that returns all 6 documents.
 There should be no other parameters in the query.


GET products/_search
{
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "name.text": "shoes shield"
    }
  }
}


"shoes shield" is a two-word query.

match query analyzes this input and splits it into tokens: ["shoes", "shield"]

Elasticsearch performs a boolean OR search by default â€” meaning documents matching either "shoes" or "shield" will be returned.
